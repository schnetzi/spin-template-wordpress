> [!CAUTION]
> You need to make changes before using this template.

### Add URL to your hosts file
To be able to access the wordpress site locally you need to add the test-domain to your hosts file.
It is explained in detail in the [serversideup documentation](https://getspin.pro/docs/guide/configuring-your-hosts-file)

### Set your email contact for Let's Encrypt certificates
Let's encrypt requires an email address to issue certificates. You can set this in the Traefik configuration for production.

```yml
# File to update:
# .infrastructure/conf/traefik/prod/traefik.yml

certificatesResolvers:
  letsencryptresolver:
    acme:
      email: "changeme@example.com"
```

Change `changeme@example.com` to a valid email address. This email address will be used by Let's Encrypt to send you notifications about your certificates.

### Trusted SSL certificates in development
We provide certificates by default. If you'd like to trust these certificates, you need to install the CA on your machine.

**Download the CA Certificate:**
- https://serversideup.net/ca/

You can create your own certificate trust if you'd like too. Just simply replace our certificates with your own.
